# Disease Alzheimer Classification Through Support Vector Machine

##### The challenge was proposed in the discipline of digital image processing at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), this was the proposal of our final project with the objective of evaluating some techniques learned during the disciplines.

In principle, this is the second version of the problem. The first was using Matlab and preprocessing the image with the techniques learned. This repository was another way I tried to apply SVM for DA detection.

This dataset is available in Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images>) and we have reduced it for practical purposes of the course.
